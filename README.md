/**
* TASK 6
* Create a class that describes a vector (in three-dimensional space).
* It must have:
* - a constructor with parameters in the form of a list of coordinates x, y, z
* - a constructor without parameters, by default all coordinates are set to 0
* - a method that calculates the length of a vector. The length of a vector is calculated using the formula: square root of x^2+y^2+z^2.
* The root can be calculated using Math.sqrt():
* - a method that calculates the scalar product of two vectors. The formula for this is: x1*x2 + y1*y2 + z1*z2
* - a method that calculates the vector product with another vector. The formula for this is: (y1*z2 - z1*y2, z1*x2 - x1*z2, x1*y2 - y1*x2)
* - methods for the sum and difference of two vectors. The formulas for this are: (x1 + x2, y1 + y2, z1 + z2) and (x1 - x2, y1 - y2, z1 - z2)
* - a static method that takes an integer N and returns an array of random vectors of size N.
* - an overridden toString() method
*
* What we practice in this task:
* - constructors with and without parameters in one class
* - writing methods that return an object of the class we wrote (Vector class)
* - overriding the toString method
* - static methods
